# inertia_blog
<p>This will serve as a development blog outlining everything I am working on to show them to potential employers or anyone interested. I hope this will give me an outlet to learn and hold me accountable to daily coding practice. Version one of this application vill use Postgres SQL, Java and Spring and Hibernate, and Angular for the frot end but V2 will use newer frameworks as I learn them better.</p>
